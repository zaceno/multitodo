# multi-todo

Live demo here: http://zaceno.github.io/multitodo

This is a basic todo-list app with multiple todo-lists (each list is called a project, each todo is called a task).

The purpose is mainly to demonstrate modularization/componentization for the purpose of reusing and encapsulating logic, in Hyperapp (which has no built in concept of stateful-components or similar)

I might be overdoing it a bit, but it's all in the spirit of being a good demo.
