# multi-todo

Live demo here: https://zaceno.github.io/multitodo

This is a basic todo-list app with multiple todo-lists (each list is called a project, each todo is called a task).

The purpose is mainly to demonstrate modularization/componentization for reuse of repeating logic and encapsulation of logic. This example could be said to go a bit overboard, but it is after all just a demo.
